/**
 * Service for KubeConfig Injection
 *
 * This feature injects kubeconfig into running DevWorkspace pods.
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: Stub
 * 
 * Full implementation requires:
 * - Pod command execution via Kubernetes API
 * - YAML parsing and merging of kubeconfig files
 * - Complex logic to detect and merge existing kubeconfigs
 * 
 * See dashboard-backend/src/devworkspaceClient/services/kubeConfigApi.ts for reference.
